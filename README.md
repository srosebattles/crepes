# Creme de la Crepe
## About this Project
This project was designed and developed by Logan Hussung and Sarah Rose Battles for an assignment during our time at the Iron Yard. Creme de la Crepe is a fictional business serving crepes in the Los Angeles area out of a food truck.

## Design
The design process began with conceptualizing a business type to feature how our food would be distributed. We landed on the idea of a food truck because they are becoming more popular in urban areas. Instead of tacos or burgers, we chose to sell crepes because they can be both sweet and savory. The primary tool we used to create our mock up was Adobe XD because of its versatility between designing and prototyping.

### Visual Appeal
We first looked for a logo that best represents our product. The colors that were already part of the logo helped us lay out our color pallet for the rest of our site. We are using a white background with grey text and red accents. Our font is Arial because of its clean sans-serif formatting and its accessibility on virtually all browsers.
### Inspiration From


##Development
We decided that our best option for the layout of our site would be using Bootstrap. Bootstrap provides an excellent source for mobile-first development. It provides a framework that facilitates a functional and responsive layout.
