      Here at Creme de la Crepe, our goal is to brighten the day of our friends and neighbors by making delectable crepes available to you at a variety of convenient locations. We select only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients to ensure your crepe is enjoyable from the first bite to the last morsel.

  </div>
  <div class="row storypage">
    <p>
      Creme de la Crepe began as a dream by two friends. After graduating from the UCLA in 2009 during a time of deep economic recession, Morgan Gusst and Cara Little both accepted positions working in food service.
      During this time, both grew discontent with the rushed, impersonal nature of drive-through service and the generic, highly-processed food choices available. So they hatched a plan to do something about it.</p>
    <p>In 2011, thanks to the investments and emotional support of family and friends, Morgan and Cara were able to obtain a loan to cover the cost of the first Creme de la Crepe truck. Initially, Creme de la Crepe served only sweet crepes and bottled water. </p>
    <p>Their crepes were an instant hit. Customers couldn’t wait to tell their friends, neighbors, and co-workers about the delicious flavors. Everyone could tell that this was a food experience that stood apart from the norm.  Soon Creme increased the beverage selection to include lemonade, iced tea, and Coca-Cola products. Another menu expansion occurred a year later, this time with options for savory crepes coming on the scene. </p>
    <p>With viral success came growth. Cara and Morgan bought a larger truck to keep up with demand, and added several members to the Creme team increase the hours per week our delicious crepes could be available to the community.</p>
    <p>In 2016, thanks to the persistence of our regulars, Creme de la Crepe finally added catering. Whether you want something better than a box of donuts to sweeten up that business meeting or are looking to feed your guests something remarkable at that graduation open house, Creme de la Crepe will be there for you.</p>
